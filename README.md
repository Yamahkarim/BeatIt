# Beat it!: 
#### Electronic Music Subgenre Classification with Machine Learning Techniques 

![dj](imgs/dj.jpg) 


## Objective 
<i>"How can we help algorithms more accuaretlety account for the complexities within electronic music?"</i> 


Create a better recommendation systems for the subgenres of electronic music with Machine Learning. 

## Scope of Work

####<u> Phase I: Understanding the Problem</u> 
<i><b>What is the problem?</b></i>


<i><b>Which questions  do we need to answer?</b></i>

A.) How do the current systems of reccomendations work?

B.) What algorithms are best for working understanding the complexities to techno and electronic music. 

- <b>Classification</b>- Use various Machine Learning models to accurately classify electronic music between 10 subgenres. 
- An expolaroty analysis of music recommendation algorithms as applied to electronic music sub-genres through the lens of academia and theoritical analysis. 

#### Phase II
- Focus on the application of music recommendation applications 

#### Phase III
- Design of a new application with a new algorithm cosisting of the products of phase I and II.
