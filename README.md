# Beat it!: 
#### Electronic Music Subgenre Classification with Machine Learning Techniques 

![dj](imgs/dj.jpg) 

## Objective 

Use various Machine Learin gmodels to accurately classify electronic music between 10 subgenres. 

## Technologies 
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Scikit Learn 
- Keras 
- Tensorflow 
- Tableau 
 

## Explore 

1.) Create and initialize a new [virtual enviornment](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) 

2.) Download the required dependencies and technologies listed above. 

3.) Clone the repo. Navigate to the downloaded repo with a CLI. 

4.) Open `index.html` for a full description of the project as well as tools to explore the code and [data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yamah.karim#!/vizhome/BeatIt/Dashboard1?publish=yes). 

5.) To walk through the code for various models, deploy a jupyter notebook. Each model is labeled as the name if the notebook.
