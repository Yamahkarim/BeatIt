# Beat it! 
#### Electronic Music Sub-genre Classification with Machine Learning Techniques 

![dj](imgs/dj.jpg) 

## Preface 

This project initially started during my time at the UCI Data Science Bootcamp as a way to understand the differences between ML algorithms through a lens in which I was familiar with- Electronic Music. As a fan of the music that lays in the avant-garde realms of techno the popular music recommendation applications such as Spotify, Pandora and SoundCloud often lack in their accuracy of recommending similar music. 


## Objective 
<i>"How can we help algorithms more accurately account for the complexities within electronic music?"</i> 


Create a better recommendation systems for the sub-genres of electronic music with Machine Learning. 

## Scope of Work

####<u> Phase I: Understanding the Problem</u> 
<i><b>What is the problem?</b></i>


<i><b>Which questions do we need to answer?</b></i>

A.) How do the current systems of recommendations work?

B.) What algorithms are best for working understanding the complexities to techno and electronic music. 

#### Phase II: Classification

- The application of most typical recommendation systems is based on the way the machine understands the (musical) composition. This is primarily done through a machine learning process known as classification, in which features are selected from the composition and then compared to other components and features to classify the composition.

-  There is a multitude of ways in which classification can be performed and this project seeks to explore the processes in order to discover the most accurate algorithm.


#### Phase III: Application

- research recommendation system applications and data engineering methods 
 * case studies: spotify, soundcloud, pandora 

- Design an application of music recommendation methods we discover.
